# Open divergences

Active gaps only. Resolved work is recorded in git history and
`docs/DEVLOG.md`; it does not belong in this file.

Last verified on `d7f2998`, which includes the reviewed capture, preview, and
exact-hand-gate commits (`44a7de3`, `27ec2fc`, `d198a96`).

Pixel-perfect means every owned, A/B-stable pixel is equal. Mean-error budgets,
hard-pixel floors, empty target captures, and unstable Oracle pairs are not
passes.

## Interactive C raster renderer

### First-person hand use poses

All three states have exact Java A/B captures but remain strict C residuals.
Ownership is the union of the Java and C subjects at threshold zero.

- Bow pull: `hard_px=30260`, `maxch=125`.
- Eat mid-use: `hard_px=101880`, `maxch=215`.
- Blocking shield: the old idle-tip golden was replaced by a genuine sticky
  `MAIN_HAND/BLOCK` capture; C still has `hard_px=28506`, `maxch=100`.

The former hand mean budget is gone. Synthetic exact controls pass, while
missing Java silhouette, C-extra, +1-channel, shift, and recolor mutations all
fail.

Likely work: finish ItemRenderer/model registration, edge shading, and the
remaining bow/eat sticky full-use capture provenance.

Repro:

```bash
bash c/magma/raster/verify/ui_hud/run_ui_hud_gates.sh
```

### Inventory player preview

GUI chrome is bit-exact, but the rendered player remains open at max channel 1:

- Pose 1: mean `0.011641`, `442` nonzero pixels.
- Pose 2: mean `0.009949`, `323` nonzero pixels.

The current path matches RenderHelper/Mesa unorm8 light-material packing for the
dominant face bins. Smaller fixed-function primary-light bins remain.

Repro:

```bash
bash c/magma/raster/verify/mc_capture/run_gui_verify.sh
```

### Portal and underwater

- Portal is `CAPTURE_BLOCKED`: the accepted pair has max-channel-1 A/B
  instability. Atomic same-client-turn `frame_pair`, sticky portal time, and
  pinned texture animation did not make a new pair exact, so no worse golden
  was promoted. C-vs-J composition also retains a large outdoor-underlay
  residual.
- Underwater is `CAPTURE_BLOCKED`: A/B reaches max channel 3 and C-vs-J remains
  about `4.97/ch`. Eye-at-surface fog is also visibly too weak.

Neither surface may pass until the Oracle pair is exact and the C full-frame
residual is zero.

### Entity and particle pixels

No strict entity family is pixel-perfect yet:

- 11 states are `CAPTURE_BLOCKED` by nonzero Java A/B on complete family ROIs:
  slime/magma sizes and squish, dig stone/grass, and dragon fireball.
- Five stable states are honest `RESIDUAL`: dragon death at ticks 50/100/190,
  small fireball, and XP orb.
- XP now has a genuine visible, full-frame A/B-exact Oracle capture; C remains
  `hard_px=12000`.
- Small fireball no longer draws on-fire layers unless `isBurning`, but its
  complete ROI remains open.
- Dragon death uses the correct 48-bit `java.util.Random`; remaining gaps are
  body pose/UV/dissolve, fine ray orientation, and surrounding scene pixels.
- Death dissolve is still per-box rather than vanilla per-texel.

Repro:

```bash
bash c/magma/raster/verify/ui_entities/run_gates.sh
bash c/magma/raster/verify/ui_entities/run_oracle_gate.sh
```

### Full-frame soft surfaces

These have useful capture-integrity checks but no pixel-perfect product claim:

- Death-screen world/tint composition outside the exact chrome and paired tint
  model remains about `33.17/ch`.
- Fire overlay full-frame composition remains open.
- Rain/overcast rendering is not modeled for the canonical rain window.
- High-altitude and long-distance haze are weaker than Java.

### Remaining isolated render features

- One-frame loading sky after a dimension transfer.
- Enchantment glint.
- Chest model rendering and world-layout seed parity.
- Arrow ghost pitch on legacy tapes.
- General held-item registration and edge shading outside the pinned use poses.
- Sheep grazing/head pose is only partially matched.
- Dig particles are reconstructed but not pixel-perfect.

## Simulation and replay

- Entity-driven world edits such as crystal-explosion fire do not replay.
- Dragon ring-buffer cold start and unload reset differ.
- Some end-to-end Oracle runs lose the dragon boss-bar registration.
- Mob roster, AI/spawn details, and boat `UNDER_WATER` state remain incomplete.
- Aim-pin target changes can add a one-tick block-break lag.
- Hotbar arrow count can drift while the Oracle shoots.
- HUD heart-flash blinking is not modeled.

## Oracle, recorder, and world-state blockers

These are not established C product bugs, but they block direct parity claims:

- Tick 9811 Oracle save-state contains flowing water absent from pristine
  worldgen.
- Live-session population order can change individual decorations.
- Legacy GUI interactions and inventory contents were not fully recorded.
- Walking/turning tapes retain partial-tick camera registration uncertainty.
- Legacy `EntityItem` rows omit required render state.
- The mine segment contains a mid-tape staged arena-state window.

When one of these is encountered, improve the recorder/pin or classify the
capture as blocked. Do not fit C output to an unproven Oracle state.
