# DEVLOG (compressed)

Code and goldens are ground truth. Short history only; full agent map is root
`AGENTS.md`. Git has the long form. Old one-shot reports: `docs/archive/`.

## What shipped (by tree)

### java/
- Playable 1.11.2 Forge+Malmo on anvil only (Mac native GL dead).
- qrl bridge: reset/step/obs, overclock, recstart/recstop tapes, tick-boundary frames.
- Drop-in JNI: sin, lightmap, biome tint, AO (`c/render-opt/dropin`).
- Play: mcwindow (framebuffer stream) or Moonlight; agent stack Xvfb :1 + VNC.
- WorldGenProbe / coverage hooks for worldgen and render path attribution.

### c/render-opt/ (effectively complete)
- 39/40 kernels bitwise vs real MC; k26 closed-by-integration (atlas UVs non-deterministic).
- Whole-frame stripcheck: native drop-ins == vanilla Java at 0 px on pinned course
  (chat/name nondeterminism pinned out).
- Intentional non-ports: GL raster, atlas stitch. Optional: full rebuildChunk VBO drop-in.

### c/mc-sim/ (kernel farm done; product wiring continues in craster)
- Dual-compile core: CPU oracle + CUDA (mostly one-thread-per-env for CPU==CUDA gates;
  real batch RL needs stage-split GPU, not serial device threads).
- Waves 0–14 verified: worldgen (OW/nether/end/flat), structures (stronghold/fortress/mineshaft),
  populate, fluids/light CA, physics, combat, crafting/smelting, portals, dragon subsets,
  tick compose, cuda_batch_tick, py_gym smoke, SPS bench.
- Fidelity rule: runtime internal consistency (CPU==CUDA); worldgen vanilla LCG seed-faithful.
- Live-game worldgen: multi-seed ~99.97% cell match via genprobe flywheel (stale-skylight,
  big-tree carry, Forge extraTreeChance, ice/snow, biome transpose bugs found and fixed).
- Open kernel-side notes (not full queues):
  - `populate` Golden.java lags stale-skylight + leaf-soil mushrooms (real oracle = world_diff).
  - GPU worldgen K1 noise: GO for many-env RL (~4.6x one CPU core); K2–K6 not built.
  - Many units are CPU==CUDA only until wired through live Java tick traces.

### c/craster/ (product binary)
- Software raster CPU+CUDA; game loop uses mc-sim headers for worldgen/sim slices.
- Macro: `test_route_e2e` seed 0 empty inv -> legally `won` (travel injects only).
- Human 12k tape: physics 1e-9 clean through t9810; t9811 = evolved-save water (fresh-world rule).
- 12k frame replay perf: ~29s -> ~8.4s (device meshes, GPU sky, pipeline, hi-z, npy frames).
- GUI table/furnace pixel-gated vs Java; product gaps listed in PRODUCT.md.
- Nightqueue 2026-07-11 items closed (lightmap, canopy root-cause, swamp M 134, etc.).

## Hard lessons worth keeping

- Goldens = real MC only (verbatim Java or live capture). Never port-vs-port.
- C needs ordered temps for multi-RNG expressions; `-ffp-contract=off` / `--fmad=false`.
- Kill game: `pkill -9 -f '[G]radleStart'`; launch game in a standalone setsid call.
- Physics tapes: human + fresh world + worldgen-verified seed. Driven tapes zero motion after land.
- CUDA twin per serial unit is a verification tax, not a throughput claim.
- Doc sprawl (kernel READMEs, WORKQUEUE, dual DEVLOGs) was agent-flywheel cost; purged 2026-07-11.

## Not open work (cuts / done)

Redstone, multiplayer, disk saves as product, audio, side structures (monuments/mansions/…),
optional villages/enchanting/brewing/weather bundles (flags reject `on` until implemented).
Render-opt lab is closed unless reopening a specific kernel directory.

Removed 2026-07-11 (unused routes): `java/build_mac.sh`, `play_mac.sh` (Mac GL dead),
`render_poc.py` + `setup_python_env.sh` (MineRL venv path; qrl is the RL bridge).

## Where next work lives

- Fidelity: `OPEN_DIVERGENCES.md` + fresh human tapes (`VERIFY.md`).
- Product surface: `PRODUCT.md` remaining gaps (models, encounters, HUD coverage, bundles).
- Sim/RL: gym beyond smoke, live-Java entity traces, optional GPU worldgen K2–K6.
- Code: `c/mc-sim/core/`, `c/craster/game/`, `java/.../qrl/`.

## 2026-07-12

- Moved consolidated `~/games/minecraft` first-party markdown into `docs/legacy-games-minecraft-learnings.md` so the old tree can be deleted without losing rationale.

## 2026-07-12 (legacy cold pack)

- Packed `~/games/minecraft` keep-set into `~/dev/minecraft/legacy-cold/` (flashmine bundle, netherite csrc, mc-oracle tar, archive).
- Retargeted `c/mc-sim/ref/netherite-csrc` to `legacy-cold/netherite-csrc`.
- Deleted hot checkouts under `~/games/minecraft` (flashmine, netherite*, mc-oracle, backups).

## 2026-07-17 (iron pickaxe across the whole RL stack)

- Extended the chain to an iron pickaxe end-to-end: craft:6 (furnace, 8 cobble, table-gated),
  craft:7 (iron pick, 3 ingot + 2 stick, table-gated) and a `smelt` primitive (extract furnace
  output, insert iron ore, insert 1 coal fuel) in all five layers: `rl_mode.c`, `cuenv_core.h`
  (CPU+CUDA from one source), `cuenv.py`, the qrl JVM bridge, and reward/trainer.
- BOLR binary obs stays FROZEN; iron visibility rides a JSON-only `inv_iron` obs field
  ([furnace, iron ore, ingot, iron pick] full-inventory counts, mirrored on the qrl bridge)
  and the trainer status vector (CU_STATUS_K 13 -> 17). Root cause of a day of "no iron
  pickup" false alarms: the hotbar is full by the iron stages, pickups overflow to the
  backpack, and hotbar-only detection can never see them.
- chain_probe iron stages (IRON=1): cobble bank, underground kit (furnace crafted BEFORE
  picks so it lands in-hotbar), snapshot-oracle iron hunt (.bsnp region parse; camera
  ghost-target pruning since earlier churn destroys oracle cells - wooden pick breaks iron
  ore with no drop), face-adjacent walk-in collection, smelt, final table + craft:7.
  FULL CHAIN seed 16: spawn -> iron pickaxe in 4114 ticks, scripted.
- Verified: replay of the 4114-tick chain on cuenv CPU vs the real env = ZERO diffs
  (verify_cpu --chain --chain-seed 16); 64 CUDA lanes vs CPU byte-exact (verify_cuda);
  live JVM smoke over the qrl socket (craft:6 -> smelt 3 ingots -> craft:7) PASS.
- reward_chain grows 5 default-0 iron milestones (exact backward compat, tested);
  ppo_chain_cu widens craft head 7 -> 9 + smelt head under IRON_CHAIN=1 only, so
  chain_net_cu_v2.pt stays loadable.

## Iron overnight train 2026-07-17
- Verified CPU chain s16 zero-diff (4114 ticks).
- CUDA chain verify in flight then IRON_CHAIN=1 PPO on GPU0 (tmux iron-overnight).
- Recipe: SUCCESS_ITEM=257, reward_iron_abuse.json, N=3072, EP_DEC=2500, wall 8h, 9-stage curriculum.
- CUENV_MAX_SNAPS 64->128 for iron capture slots.
- Codex seed-harden 29/3 in tmux iron-seed-harden.
- Morning: bash c/craster/rl/out/morning_iron_status.sh

## 2026-07-20 (docs consolidation)

- Single agent entry: root `AGENTS.md`. How-tos/history under `docs/`
  (`RUNBOOK`, `BOOTSTRAP`, `GATES`, `DEVLOG`). Archaeology in `docs/archive/`.
- Living contracts stay next to code (`c/*/SPEC.md`, craster PRODUCT/VERIFY/OPEN_DIVERGENCES).
- Root no longer holds DEVLOG or product/report markdown.

## 2026-07-21 (bot-recorded canonical tape + torch placement chase)

- New canonical tape 20260721T215812Z: recorded end-to-end by progression_bot
  (no human input), 3,617 ticks, physics-exact at 1e-9, pixel gate PASS.
  CANON_TAPE swapped in netherite_sweep.sh; VERIFY.md/GATES.md updated.
- Renderer/sim fixes it surfaced: crack decal face mapping (frame_capture),
  torch viewmodel item/generated routing (hand.c), torch placement support
  validation + refire hit-face from AABB calculateIntercept semantics
  (player_ctl, sel_box ray_box_hit, blaze_core cu_ray_box_hit; OPEN_DIVERGENCES
  #55), cross-plant vanilla random offsets (mesh_mc), CUDA overlay pinned-buffer
  race (frame_capture).
- KNOWN ISSUE (RESOLVED same day, see below): blaze-cuda-chain appeared to hang
  on GPU1 (sm_86) at ~tick 185 of the s10 chain.

## 2026-07-21 (later: sweep fully green + fidelity round via agent fan-out)

- blaze-cuda-chain "hang" root-caused (codex): NOT a spin. The verify-helper
  k_emit rendered all 2,304 camera rays on a SINGLE CUDA thread; a camera
  change near tick 185 raised traversal cost enough that sm_86 looked wedged.
  Fix: k_emit_cam renders one thread per pixel, then the single-thread record
  assembly runs on the same stream (blaze_cuda.cu). Chain gate byte-exact on
  GPU1/sm_86 in ~120 s (was: killed at 1200 s), semantics unchanged.
- magma-test-config re-enabled: test_config.c capture buffer 1024 -> 4096
  (usage text had outgrown it).
- Viewmodel fidelity (codex): vanilla ItemRenderer equip lower/raise + retained
  stack, swing restart at half animation, ItemLayerModel per-texel rim quads.
  Canonical tape: viewmodel 518,463 -> 470,440 px, hud 471,103 -> 397,903.
  tests/test_hand_torch.c updated to assert the exact per-texel topology.
- HUD fidelity (codex): hotbar durability strip (renderItemOverlayIntoGUI),
  meta in GmPlayerView, exact GUI mini-cube lighting/UVs. hud -5,332 px more.
- Particles finding (codex, honest negative result): the 'particles' gate class
  is misnamed - pixel_gate classifies any oracle-brighter cluster as particles;
  the dominant 87k cluster is a broad terrain-LIGHTING divergence during the
  dig windows (t3080-3160, t3320-3400). Real debris is minor and RNG-unmatchable;
  implementing it made the class worse, so it was rejected. Follow-up agent is
  chasing the lighting root cause (world/light.c incremental relight suspect).

## 2026-07-22 (brute-force triptych round: crack/stone/foliage/cave-light)

- Method change per operator: rank keyframe diffs (grind.py), eyeball the
  triptychs directly, characterize the artifact class visually, then hand the
  numerics to a codex round. Four root causes landed this way.
- Crack overlay (codex): block-damage overlay now renders full model faces
  with per-face crack UVs (vertical faces were mirrored, bottom rotated 90);
  stage = floor(progress*10)-1 per PlayerControllerMP.
- Polished stone (codex): granite/diorite/andesite metas 2/4/6 no longer fall
  through to plain stone; model-oracle coverage added.
- Foliage lighting: compute_skylight_spread read the renderer block id
  instead of the packed vanilla state for sky opacity; cube faces now use
  vanilla useNeighborBrightness (mc_light_for_ext) and cross-plants take
  neighbor combined light. Sidecar #40 filed: oracle-only ParticleDigging
  burst at t3160, surfaced once foliage skylight matched.
- Cave/canopy brightness (my measurement, codex root cause): ~64 mid-tape
  frames sat at a flat 9.06 mean/ch with magma/oracle = 1.2286 exactly,
  channel-uniform. Cause: light_set_state seeded EVERY state load with sky 15,
  so metadata-only leaf loads clobbered stored skylight under the canopy
  (Moody lightmap bytes 197/160 = 1.23125 - the measured scalar). Fix follows
  World.checkLightFor: metadata-only loads keep stored skylight; opacity
  changes re-derive via canSeeSky + flood. Tape median 8.69 -> 0.16 mean/ch;
  plateau frames 9.1 -> 0.01. Gate PASS both repos; quick sweep green.
- Worktree gotcha recorded: tracked sidecar json is NOT symlinked into
  worktrees - editing the main-tree copy silently leaves the worktree stale
  (cost one full replay to spot: active entries [] at the failing tick).

## 2026-07-22 (scenario harness: scripted combat/GUI/anim environments, six-round codex fan-out)

- New transferable scenario harness (raster/verify/scenarios/): YAML spec ->
  oracle boot -> phased setup (one runcmds batch per command + settle ticks;
  a single batch executes in ONE server tick, so tp-dependent fills/summons
  fail; vanilla also reports no-op clear/fill-air as failure) -> mcwindow
  input script -> tape -> replay gate. setup_qrl passes raw bridge steps
  (dim {id:1} for End entry).
- Eight tapes all rc=0 with gate PASS, each divergence root-caused by a codex
  round and re-verified here: canonical, smoke zombie, blaze melee, blaze
  bow, pigmen aggro, wither skeleton, enderman fight, ender dragon.
- Smoke zombie harvest: zombie melee was 4.0 (vanilla 3.0) and replay
  double-applied saturation regen across packet timing (13/6 vs 4/3 hp).
- Night scene ~2x dark: bulk snapshot loads bypassed Chunk.generateSkylightMap
  semantics (light_load_state now re-derives column skylight per batch);
  7.51 -> 1.47/ch. Pink hotbar icon = missing diamond_sword GUI atlas entry.
- GUI actions (8-step scripted inventory sequence, cursor-driven): paper doll
  (drawEntityOnScreen), hover highlight/tooltip (GuiContainer/GuiUtils),
  armor/offhand placeholder sprites, achievement-toast harness contamination
  (pre-grant achievement.openInventory). Panels 1.2-4.2 -> 0.15-0.26/ch.
- Texture animation: replay never seeded total_time, so every animated tile
  ran from clock zero (portal masked it via recorded frameCounter). Lava
  (20-frame fwd/rev) + fire (custom sequences) implemented; underwater
  overlay burst was sparse ppos anchoring, now per-row anchors. Negative
  control (time-shifted candidate) now genuinely separates per region.
- Combat physics: replay dropped ent_box collision impulses whenever velocity
  packets existed (Entity.applyEntityCollision); wither skeleton = skeleton
  model 1.2x + stone sword (8.0 raw) + wither DoT (%40 pulses through hurt
  resistance); hurt-resistance/lastDamage gating implemented; nether brick
  had no block model (rendered as stone); held items ignored the night
  lightmap. Dragon: contact damage from recorded envelopes via causeMobDamage
  + hurt-resistance ledger reproduces death at t606 exactly; dragon-breath
  AoE cloud is RNG-unmatchable -> scoped sidecar known:40.
- End entry scenario note: seed-0 obsidian platform is embedded in the island
  (tape one was 1600 ticks of inside-wall view; also surfaced that magma and
  the oracle disagree on camera-inside-block near-plane rendering - open).
- All mirrored to mono with drift vocabulary preserved (10 commits, mono
  canonical rc=0); mirror of the combat/dragon rounds pending this batch.
